- 👋 Hi, I’m Andres (andres-vg), I enjoy programming, and in fact used to be a developer, for the most part doing real time systems and multi-threaded components in C/C++ for Windows and Xbox (low level layers), 5 years ago I quit my software job and started doing electrical work (yes, as an electrical contractor). Now I am going back to doing software with a revived gusto, however, my focus now are small machines (i.e. micro-controllers and embedded systems).
- 👀 I’m interested in micro-controllers, real time systems, network protocols, IoT, and similar, but also music related apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about micro-controllers (started with Arduino Uno), GIT, GitHub, bash, VS Code, PlatformIO, I2C, ISP, FreeRTOS, and just getting into the programming mood again.
- 💞️ My main focus is my learning, but would like at some point to contribute to some open source apps that I love, like mixxx and Audacity.
