- 👋 Hi, I’m @andres-vg, I am a developer with 20+ years of programming experience, for the most part doing real time systems and multi-threaded applications in C/C++ for Windows and Xbox (low level layers), 5 years ago I quit my software job and started doing electrical work (yes, as an electrical contractor), but now I'm going back to doing software, which I enjoy a lot, however, my focus now are small systems (i.e. micro-controllers and embedded systems).
- 👀 I’m interested in micro-controllers, real time systems, network protocols, IoT, which are the focus of my coming back to software, but also music related apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently actively learning about micro-controllers (Arduino Uno, others to come), GIT, GitHub, bash, VS Code, PlatformIO, I2C, ISP, and getting into the programming mood every day.
- 💞️ My main focus is my learning, but would love to contribute to some open source apps that I love, like mixxx and Audacity.
