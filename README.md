- 👋 Hi, I’m Andres (andres-vg), most of my experience as a programmer has been writing code for real time systems and multi-threaded applications, primarily in C/C++ and for Windows and Xbox platforms.
- 👀 I’m interested in micro-controllers, real time systems, network protocols, IoT, and similar, but also music related apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about technologies I did not use (or not much) in my past jobs, such as micro-controllers (started with Arduino Uno), GIT, GitHub, bash, VS Code, PlatformIO, I2C, ISP, FreeRTOS.
- 💞️ My main focus at the moment is my learning of the above technologies, but if time and interest permit, I would like to  contribute to some apps I love, like mixxx and Audacity.
